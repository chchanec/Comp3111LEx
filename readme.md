# COMP3111H Honors Software Engineering (4 units)

## Self introduction

### Hello everyone!

I am **CHAN, Chun Hin** and I am taking ***COMP3111H*** currently!

(Note: COMP3111H is taught by Professor Kenneth Leung Wai Ting this semester.)


## Description

Welcome to this page!

This is my very **1st** lab in COMP3111H - Honors Software Engineering

(Note: COMP3111 is Software Engineering, whereas COMP3111H is Honors Software Engineering)

What I have learned in lab 1:

1. I have learned the way to build a Java Project in IntelliJ
2. I have successfully created my first GitHub to share project source with others

Below is the screenshot of my 1st lab project in IntelliJ:
